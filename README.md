## What is *flrish*?

##### Flourish (verb)
  1. Grow or develop in a healthy or vigorous way, especially as the result of a particularly congenial environment.
  2. Develop rapidly and successfully.

**Flrish** is a marketplace for indie game developers to upload and sell their games to a passionate community of fans. 

It is designed to be a place where developers and customers can both have the best experience when it comes to buying and selling video games.

It is a community of like-minded, and passionate people to come together. For developers, it is a place where they can get a foot in the door and start selling their work. For customers, it is a place where they can support the things they love and help developers to grow.

## The Problem

There are so many ways for aspiring developers or indie developers to sell their games these days, however, it is also harder than ever to get your games noticed. Other markets are flooded with too many games, and don't have a community that promotes innovation, development and growth of video games as a medium. 

## The Solution

A marketplace-community that is solely for indie developers or aspiring developers to showcase and sell thier games to a passionate community. The website will allow users to easily find games they will love and allow developers and their games to **flourish**.
